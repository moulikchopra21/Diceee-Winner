This site is a simple web-based dice rolling game where two players roll a virtual dice, and the player with the higher roll wins. The game is built using **HTML** for the structure, **CSS** for styling, and **JavaScript** for the dice roll functionality and dynamic interactions. When you refresh the page, the dice are rolled again, and the winner is displayed based on the higher dice value. The game runs entirely on the frontend, making it a lightweight and interactive experience
